# SHI_WAR
Automate WAR process.

WAR.py == main method

next_week_planned == grab outlook window, bring front, send keypress to find calendar, snapshot and crop calendar image for main war report.

Don't judge the messy code-- it was built for speed, not efficiency (and definitely not elegance).

Additional work intended:
1. streamline/modify into proper init/methods.
2. automate CRM interaction.
3. auto generate email (ask if additional input required/commentary).
